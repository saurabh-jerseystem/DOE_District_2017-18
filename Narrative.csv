A lottery is conducted each year as spaces for preschool are limited.  The preschool curriculum consists of developmentally appropriate experiences that provide each child with individual opportunities to develop positive self-esteem, social/emotional growth, language skills, motor development and conceptual skill development. Proof of immunizations against communicable diseases and examinations is in accord with requirements for kindergarten and first grade admission. Our preschool program is well received by parents.","Welcome! Montvale is a charming, child-centered community of approximately 8,000 residents nestled away in picturesque northern Bergen County, NJ.

Murphy signed a new law to modernize the school funding formula on Tuesday, July 24th, ensuring Kingsway will receive the state aid it rightfully deserves moving forward.  Kingsway’s efforts have helped to benefit not only the 3,000 students at Kingsway but also the nearly one million students state-wide who carried the unenviable ‘underfunded’ flag. The new law (S-2) is designed to put Kingsway on track to receive our full entitlement by the 2024-25 school year. This will bring Kingsway from 58 percent of our full, uncapped state aid entitlement to 100 percent; an anticipated increase of more than $8.5 million over the next six years. This allows Kingsway’s administration and the Board of Education to more accurately forecast revenue projections and prioritize funding needs on an annual basis.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2017-18

The language used for instruction is broken down by a 50/50 ratio. Fifty percent of classroom instruction is provided in English and fifty percent of classroom instruction is provided in Spanish. The goal is for all students to read, write, listen, and speak two languages equally well by the end of the program.

Reading, language arts, math, science, and social studies, are taught in both Spanish and English.  The diversity at GBCS provides an ideal platform for all students to have the opportunity to learn and develop a second language. Through the dual language program, students are exposed to rigorous curriculum and given the opportunity to learn a second language.  In 2017 all Kindergarten, First Grade and Second Grade classes are dual language, not monolingual.  Grades Three to Five remain mixed, one class of each grade being dual language and the other monolingual.   Dual Language Program Goals:  One of our goals is “To prepare all students to become productive, responsible and contributing members of our changing global society by providing a nurturing environment that rigorously promotes the realization of individual potential.” Students in the dual language program are presented with the social and cognitive benefits of bilingualism.
